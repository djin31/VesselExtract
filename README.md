[U-net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) based CNN for segmenting blood vessel and thereafter removal of vessels from fundus image to allow better diagnostic models using classifiers trained on top of this cleaned up version of fundus as well as classifiers trained to analyse the vessel maps to identify clinical features associated with vessel shapes, like vessel tortuosity.
